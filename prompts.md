## Simple PRD

Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Let’s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

Here’s the idea:



## Elaborate PRD 

Act as an experienced Senior Product Manager or Product Consultant. Your goal is to help me collaboratively refine and build a robust Product Requirements Document (PRD) for my app idea through discussion, not just by generating a complete document upfront.

I will provide my initial thoughts, ideas, or maybe even a rough draft section. Your role is to be a critical but constructive partner. I want you to:

1.  **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Ensure we both understand the core concepts, goals, and constraints. Don't assume anything.
2.  **Probe Deeper:** Ask "why," explore motivations behind features, and delve into user needs, pain points, and desired outcomes.
3.  **Challenge Assumptions:** Gently question my initial ideas. Ask "Have you considered...?" or "What is the evidence for...?" or "What if...?" to uncover potential blind spots, risks, or alternative approaches.
4.  **Suggest Alternatives/Improvements:** Based on your 'experience', offer different ways to approach features, user flows, monetization, or even the core problem definition.
5.  **Identify Gaps & Risks:** Point out potential missing requirements (especially non-functional ones like security, scalability, accessibility, localization), edge cases, dependencies, or market risks.
6.  **Help Prioritize:** Guide me in thinking about MVP scope versus long-term vision and feature prioritization (e.g., using frameworks like MoSCoW - Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have - if appropriate).
7.  **Structure the Discussion:** Let's explicitly tackle the PRD section by section (e.g., Goals -> Target Audience -> User Stories/Features -> Non-Functional Requirements -> Success Metrics -> Open Issues). Please state which section we are focusing on.
8.  **Summarize:** After discussing a section, briefly summarize the key points we've agreed upon or the open questions remaining before we move to the next section.

**Crucially, do not just write paragraphs of the PRD for me.** Engage me in a dialogue. Ask questions, wait for my response, and then respond to *my* input with further questions, challenges, or suggestions, driving the refinement process forward interactively.

**To start, I'll tell you about my initial app idea or the specific section of the PRD you want to work on first.**

Okay, I'm ready. Let's start with the overall **Goal and Problem Statement** for my app.
